This directory contains the C codes for petscSolveCRS generated by m2c.

There are three sets of files:
Core Library Files (for building a portable library for C):
    petscSolveCRS_types.h: Declaration of data types
    petscSolveCRS.h: Declaration of functions
    petscSolveCRS.c: Implementation of functions

    Dependent files m2c.h, m2c.c and rtwtypes.h are in ../../include.

MEX Function Files (for building a MATLAB/Octave executable):
    petscSolveCRS_mex.c: Definition of MexFunction.
    mex_petscSolveCRS.m: MATLAB script for compiling MEX function
    Additional dependent file lib2mex_helper.c is included.

Main Function (for building a standalone executable for debugging/profiling):
    petscSolveCRS_exe.c: Definition of main function that read/write MAT files.
    build_petscSolveCRS_exe.m: MATLAB script for compiling executible.
    Additional dependent file lib2exe_helper.c are in ../../include.
